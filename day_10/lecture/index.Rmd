## Dad Joke

Interviewer: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

Me: "Listening. I would say listening is my biggest weakness."


## Online 674

> - FlipGrid
>	- Discussion of readings
>	- Programming questions?
> - Assignments
> - Lectures and example code
> - Do what you can, and I'll do the same

## Adjustments to schedule

> - Text analysis to next week
> - Screen scraping to the end
> - This includes readings, so LMK if that messes up your schedule
> - Planning document feedback by Friday

## API assignments

> - Goal is to take you through the whole process with a simple question
> - I will work on some solutions + video
> - Good approach for bigger API-based projects
>	- 3 scripts:
>		- First gets raw data and saves it
>		- Second processes it into a CSV
>		- Third creates measures, plots, etc.
>	- Make your process reproducible

## Cleaning data

> - Why is data 'dirty'?
>	- Errors in transcription
>	- Bugs in software that produced it
>	- Missing data (e.g., when a date is unknown it's recoded as Jan 1)
>	- Can't be read by software
>	  - Wrong date format
>	  - Multiple age formats - e.g., '4', '4 yo', '4 years'
>	- Observations that shouldn't be in the analysis
>	- Inappropriate for statistical tests
>	  - log-transformations
>	  - Coding groups (e.g., high-risk and low-risk)

## Operationalization

> - Making a construct measurable
>	- Constructs are not empirical and can't be tested directly
>	- We must argue that our measures represent or at least are correlated with the concepts we really care about
>	- Hypotheses relate concepts together, e.g., "socially cohesive groups are more willing to contribute to shared goals"
>	- In order to test this, need to argue that you have something that represents social cohesion, and something that represents shared goals.

## Online data

> - Online data is "raw"
>	- This is generally wonderful - we have actual conversations, full text, etc.
> - However, it isn't made for researchers
>	- It isn't designed to measure a construct
>	- We have to do the work to create measures that measure them (and recognize when we can't)

## Thanks

> - Stay safe
> - Stay inside
