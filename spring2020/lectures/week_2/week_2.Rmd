# Week 2

## Quick housekeeping item
- Do we want to change rooms?

# Things I should have mentioned last week

## The wiki and the class
> - Based on other courses, some wiki content overlaps with course at University of Washington
>	- There may be inconsistencies or errors
>	- If you can, fix them! 
> - Order of readings and assignments
> - Class time is review of readings + difficulties with HW + start on next week's HW?
> - How to encourage interaction? Work in pairs?

## Brightspace

> - Readings
> - Discussion board
> - Example Projects
> - Names and netids of auditing students


## Additional Readings

> - Sign up sheet
> - What do we want this to look like?

## Project Options

> - I'm compiling some example projects
> - Whatever is most valuable for you
>	- Methods + result section of paper
>	- Jupyter notebook
>	- Replication

## Random participation

```{python, echo=T}
seed = 121
import pandas as pd

names = pd.read_csv('../class_list.csv')

shuffled_names = names.sample(frac=1,random_state = seed).Name.values

shuffled_names[0]

```

## Random participation

> - Slightly scary way to encourage mutual accountability
> - Helps add diversity to our discussion
> - Passing is OK

## Bit By Bit

> - Did the distinction between "readymade" and "custommade" data resonate with you?
>	- Where does the line blur between these two types?
>	- How does this distinction differ from the quantitative/qualitative dichotomy?

## Bit By Bit

> - Would you rather read more of this book or read more example papers?

## Programming Principles Review

> - What is a string?
> - What is the difference between RAM and a hard drive?
> - What is a variable?
>- What is an interactive python prompt? How is that different from a program file?
> - What do you still have questions about?
