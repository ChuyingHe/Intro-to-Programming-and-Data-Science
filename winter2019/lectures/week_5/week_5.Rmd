## Paper discussion

Margolin, D. B., Hannak, A., & Weber, I. (2018). Political Fact-Checking on Twitter: When Do Corrections Have an Effect? Political Communication, 35(2), 196â€“219.

> - Lots of evidence that people don't act like "intuitive scientists"
>	- Misinformation doesn't change opinions
>	- Rumors propagation happens even in the face of corrections
> - Key question of their study:
>	- What are the social conditions that encourage retraction/opinion change?

## Hypotheses

> - H1: People are more likely to accept corrections from friends
> - H2: People are more likely to accept corrections from those embedded in same group (larger shared audience)
> - RQ: How do audience sizes affect likelihood to accept corrections?

## Paper discussion

> - Method
>	- Twitter "garden hose" to identify tweets where:
>	  - "Snopee" shares misinformation
>	  - "Snoper" shares link to correction
>	  - "Snopee" responds
>	- Coded the content of the correction and response
>	- Regression to predict when a correction was accepted
> - H1 was accepted; no strong effect for others.

## Questions

> - What were some strengths of the research design? Weaknesses?
> - What is the next study you would design to complement this study?
> - How much do you think the context influenced the results?
