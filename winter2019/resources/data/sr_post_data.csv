I am pleased to have language translation support today from student scientists Ms. Chaerin Yim and Ms. Yunha Cho.

The initial UK government approach has been a total failure. Ask me anything.","Hey r/Coronavirus. After two very long weeks, I'm back for another AMA. If you didn't see my last, I look after critically ill COVID patients in a UK centre. The last time we talked, there were around 20 patients admitted to critical care for COVID nationally. A week after that post, that number was over 200 confirmed (with at least as many suspected cases) across the country. In London, the number has been doubling every few days.

I have a couple of days off, and I'm here to take questions on the current situation, the UK government response, or anything else you might want to talk about.

Like before, I'm remaining anonymous as this allows me to answer questions freely and without association to my employer (and I'm also not keen on publicity or extra attention or getting in trouble with my hospital's media department).

“Help with the fight against SARS-CoV-2 from home: donate your computer’s background CPU &amp; GPU time to researchers and clinicians using Rosetta@Home &amp; Folding@Home”,"Hello all.

I want to inform you of the work distributed computing is doing researching SARS-CoV-2.  Given the precipitous worldwide explosion of cases, state and national emergency proclamations, and general clinical belief that things will get much worse before they become better, I hope you will consider putting your computing resources toward this task.

Here are some initial comments on how [Rosetta@home](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2020/02/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus/) and [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/) are helping to understand and combat SARS-CoV-2.

Distributed computing is a simple concept - an institution takes a large chunk of data and breaks it up into small pieces. The data is sent to participating computers.  Your computer does the number crunching and the finished product is sent back to be added to the whole body of research. The programs can run invisibly in the background, whenever you're not using the computer, or full time. The installation takes up a small amount of space, and you can easily control how much of your computer processing power you want dedicated to either program.

Most of us may not be scientists, virologists, epidemiologists or researchers but that doesn’t mean we are helpless or unable to contribute. Much can be done if we work together as a team, a country, and an international community.

"Welcome to this AMA. I’m Jason Call, progressive running for WA-02 against incumbent Dem Rick Larsen, who is 75% funded by CorpPACs, opposes M4A ＆ is a pro-extinction Dem. As chair of the House Aviation Subcommittee, oversaw 737MAX failure, cost 1000s of jobs, ＆ gave a fired CEO $60 mil.","I have lived in Washington since 1983, and have been a constituent of Rick Larsen’s since he was elected in 2000. I’ve been at odds with Rick’s style of corporate friendly politics since he broke ranks with the Democrats in 2005 and voted for Joe Biden’s Bankruptcy Reform bill. This district is considered a D+10 district, which means it’s a solidly Democratic district that has no business being represented by a conservative Democrat. We need Green New Deal policies here, where we are ripe for investments in sustainable/renewable energies, and where we have more coastline that will be impacted by rising tides than almost any other district in the nation. 

I’ve been an elected member of the Washington State Democrats Central Committee since 2016, and have helped rewrite the state platform and written and passed a boatload of progressive resolutions. I’ve also been a member of the board of Whole Washington, the volunteer driven organization that is working to bring single payer healthcare to Washington State. I am in full support of Medicare For All as national health policy.
